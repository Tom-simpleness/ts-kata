# Fizzbuzz kata

- Write a function that takes a number and outputs it as a string.
- For multiples of three return "fizz" instead of the number.
- For the multiples of five return “buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “fizzbuzz" instead of the number.

## Folow TDD rules stryctly

1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
2. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
3. Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.

## Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **1**     | "1"        |
| **2**     | "2"        |
| **3**     | "fizz"     |
| **4**     | "4"        |
| **5**     | "buzz"     |
| **6**     | "fizz"     |
| **7**     | "7"        |
| **8**     | "8"        |
| **9**     | "fizz"     |
| **10**    | "buzz"     |
| **11**    | "11"       |
| **12**    | "fizz"     |
| **13**    | "14"       |
| **14**    | "15"       |
