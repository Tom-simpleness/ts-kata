## The problem

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures.

## Your tasks

### Add Characterization tests

Write characterization tests to describe the code as is.

#### Guidelines

- Write an assertion that you know will fail
- Run the test and let the failure tell you what the actual behaviour is
- Change the test so that it expects the behaviour that the code actually produces
- Repeat
- Use a code coverage tool to help you identify areas of the code that have no test coverage

Write characterization tests to describe the code as is.

### Add mutation tests

- Use mutation tests to further increase the confidence on your tests
- Add any missing tests the mutation tool uncovers

### Add approval tests

- Use approval tests to test the solution instead of characterization tests
- Note the advantages/disadvantages of using one approach or the other
