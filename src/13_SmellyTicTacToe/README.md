# Code Smells kata

## The problem

We created a very smelly implementation of TicTacToe.

There are a number of code smells in the implementation namely:

- Primitive obsession
- Feature envy
- Data class
- Message chain
- Long method
- Comments
- Long parameter list
- Shotgun surgery
- Duplicated code
- Large class
- Divergent change
- Data clump
- Lazy class
- Dead code

## Your tasks

### First run

Start by identifying the code smells, add comments where you find code smells.

### Second run

Refactor the code to remove the identified code smells using the specific code smell refactoring guidelines.

- Remember to keep the tests passing at all times during the refactor
- For every refactor run the tests and if they pass commit
- It's ok to revert back to a previous working state at any moment

### Refactoring Priority Premise

Try to follow these guidelines that prioritize what code smells to tackle first.

- Refactor readability
  - Comments
  - Dead code
  - Magic strings and numbers
  - Scope (variables, blocks)
  - Clutter
  - Implicit knowledge
  - Naming
- Reduce complexity
  - Duplicated code
  - Long method
- Reorder responsibilities
  - Data class
  - Message chain
  - Feature Envy
  - Inappropriate Intimacy
  - Large class
- Refine abstractions
  - Long parameter list
  - Data clump
  - Primitive obsession
  - Middle man
- Refactor to design patterns
  - Switch statments
  - Strategy
  - State
  - Command
  - others
- Refactor to SOLID
  - Refused bequest
  - Divergent change
  - Shotgun surgery
  - Speculative generality
  - Paralell inheritance
